## Installation
For now only a flatpak image is available, but I'm planning to make packages for different distributions in the future.

## Todo
- [ ] Create rpm, deb, aur etc. Flathub?
- [ ] Show different controls for lights with different features
- [ ] Edit location, group
- [ ] Migrate to HdyFlap
- [ ] Migrate to GTK4
- [ ] Add translations
